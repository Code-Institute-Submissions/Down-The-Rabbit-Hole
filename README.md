<h2 id="ux"><u>UX</u></h2>
The website's primary purpose is to promote this small start up business. It will be used to not only display artwork and provide examples of possible designs but also to invite viewers to contact the artist for personalised designs as well. The website will also provide a look into the artists existing Etsy shop and allow website visitors to purchase these items. The ultimate goal will be to generate new business for the company as well as a way for existing customers to re-order.


<h4 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h4>
Please see the wireframes for this project:<br>
<a href="./assets/documentation/Wireframe.pdf" target="_blank">Desktop</a><br>
<a href="./assets/documentation/Wireframe-mobile.pdf" target="_blank">Mobile</a>

<h4 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h4>

<ul>
<li>The first audience that this website will be targeting is customers who are art enthusiasts and fellow artists that are local to the artist. They will be able to actually visit the studio and purchase items directly from the artist.</li>
<li>The second target would be national and even international customers that are looking to purchase unique artwork. As the artist already has an international following on Instagram so this website will be aimed at these followers to allow them to asily purchase items.</li>
<li>Finally, this website would be looking to target customers who want a personalised piece of art creating to their exact specifications in any media that they choose.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="website-aim">Website Aim</h4>
<ul>
<li>The main aim of the website will be to raise awareness of the artist and where to find their studio and to help them attract more customers.</li>
<li>The website will also be looking to showcase artwork from the artist to give potential customers an idea of the options available to them should they wish to purchase.</li>
<li>A primary aim is to provide a link to the artists's existing Etsy shop so that purchases can be made without any additional contact to the seller. By using the existing Etsy shop, it will also provide confidence in the buying process as it will use a verified merchant.</li>
<li>The website will be looking to provide an easy link to the artist and a way of contacting them directly to get personalised artwork created.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="user-stories">User Stories</h4>
<ul>
<li>As a personal customer I would like to explore the services offered, to do this I can easily click on the "Services" page and scroll through the options available.</li>
<li>As a personal customer I would like to check the reputation of the business and their safety procedures. I can easily access the Covid safety procedures via the link in the footer and can see the testimonials from other customers as soon as I access the webpage.</li>
<li>As a business customer I would like to ensure the service I require is available and get a quick and easy quote. I can do this simply by accessing the "Services" page and once I have found the service required, I can use the Contact Form to send a request.</li>
<li>As a user of the website I would like to be able to use the website on any type of device and be able to navigate through the website easily on any device. I have tried the website on a tablet, mobile and a desktop and the layout remains the same so I can easily access the pages required.</li>
<li>As a user I want to be able to locate contact details easily from any page on the website. I am able to find the contact number and email address easily via the website footer which is available on every page.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="design">Design</h4>
This project has been tailored towards the artistic target audience, with the aims in mind.<br>
<ul>
<li>With the aim of the website trying to attract atristic customers, the website design has been created to showcase as much of the artist's work as possible. There are many images on show which will be the first thing that are seen by website users.</li>
<li>The colour scheme has been chosen to link in with the websites name - Down the Rabbit Hole. As a homage to Alice in Wonderland, the colour scheme has been chosen to match that of the Cheshire Cat (pink and purple).</li>
<li>Many potential customers not only want to see proof of the artists achievements but also find out about the artist's background. Therefore the homepage is dedicated to the artist and her background as well as the type of media she uses.</li>
<li>For those who are already aware of the artist and are maybe returning customers, there are easy links to the "Shop" and the "Contact" page so they can start browsing new products straightaway.</li>
</ul>
