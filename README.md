<h2 id="ux"><u>UX</u></h2>
The website's primary purpose is to promote this small start up business. It will be used to not only display artwork and provide examples of possible designs but also to invite viewers to contact the artist for personalised designs as well. The website will also provide a look into the artists existing Etsy shop and allow website visitors to purchase these items. The ultimate goal will be to generate new business for the company as well as a way for existing customers to re-order.


<h4 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h4>
Please see the wireframes for this project:<br>
<a href="assets/images/Desktop.pdf" target="_blank">Desktop</a><br>
<a href="assets/images/Mobile.pdf" target="_blank">Mobile</a>

<h4 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h4>

<ul>
<li>The first audience that this website will be targeting is customers who are art enthusiasts and fellow artists that are local to the artist. They will be able to actually visit the studio and purchase items directly from the artist.</li>
<li>The second target would be national and even international customers that are looking to purchase unique artwork. As the artist already has an international following on Instagram so this website will be aimed at these followers to allow them to asily purchase items.</li>
<li>Finally, this website would be looking to target customers who want a personalised piece of art creating to their exact specifications in any media that they choose.</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="website-aim">Website Aim</h4>
<ul>
<li>The main aim of the website will be to raise awareness of the artist and where to find their studio and to help them attract more customers.</li>
<li>The website will also be looking to showcase artwork from the artist to give potential customers an idea of the options available to them should they wish to purchase.</li>
<li>A primary aim is to provide a link to the artists's existing Etsy shop so that purchases can be made without any additional contact to the seller. By using the existing Etsy shop, it will also provide confidence in the buying process as it will use a verified merchant.</li>
<li>The website will be looking to provide an easy link to the artist and a way of contacting them directly to get personalised artwork created.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="user-stories">User Stories</h4>
As a user of the website, the following actions and results would be required.
<ol>
<li>I would like to be able to browse and purchase items that are for sale by the artist.</li>
<li>I would like to be able to see a gallery of artwork created by the artist to see if the styles and designs are what I am looking for.</li>
<li>As a local customer, I would like to be able to easily find the address and location of the artists studio so I can view the artwork in person. </li>
<li>I would like to be able to contact the artist for personalised artwork and for a quote.</li>
<li>I would like to be able to follow the artist on social media so I can keep up to date with new artwork that is available.</li>
<li>I would like to be able to navigate between the webpages without having to return to the homepage.</li></ol>

<h4 id="design">Design</h4>
This project has been tailored towards the artistic target audience, with the aims in mind.<br>
<ul>
<li>With the aim of the website trying to attract artistic customers, the website design has been created to showcase as much of the artist's work as possible. There are many images on show which will be the first thing that are seen by website users.</li>
<li>The colour scheme has been chosen to link in with the websites name - Down the Rabbit Hole. As a homage to Alice in Wonderland, the colour scheme has been chosen to match that of the Cheshire Cat (pink and purple).</li>
<li>Many potential customers not only want to see proof of the artists achievements but also find out about the artist's background. Therefore the homepage is dedicated to the artist and her background as well as the type of media she uses.</li>
<li>For those who are already aware of the artist and are maybe returning customers, there are easy links to the "Shop" and the "Contact" page so they can start browsing new products straightaway.</li>
</ul>
